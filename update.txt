Since I changed a lot of things, I thought it would be 

- Replaced Connection's ServerIdx property with cfg, which references the config file linked to the port of the fd.
- Simplified functions calls by removing arguments HttpReq/HttpRes/ServerConf from functions that also take a Connection object as argument, as those attributes can be accessed from the Connection object.
- Added public *Loc to Connection's properties, which points to NULL by default.
- Replaced convoluted IHandler system with a much simpler setup:

		- Router::route
			Looks for a matching connection for the request path
			Sets the connection's *loc to the match (to root if none is found)
			compare the request's method to the matched location allowed methods, set error if not found.

		- (only for GET/HEAD requests) Router::handle is called based on the the return of Router::route.
			- if the target is a directory => 
				if loc.hasIndex: return index
				else if autoindex -> return dir-listing
				else return error
			- if the target is a regular file =>
				if it doesnt exist -> return error
			 	else setContentType, headers etc...

www_giulio:

	- Changed POST / DELETE calls that previously targetted cgi to simply make the request 
		(eg: POST /uploads/audio/new.mp3 will be routed to /ressources/uploads/audio/new.mp3 in config)

	- Every button now has an hover effect that displays what it requests to the server when clicked.

	- Improved MineSweeper which now generate valid maps and is generally more fun to play (terribly out of scope)


test.py:

	Added POST / DELETE / cgi tests

Logger:

	Refined logs format, tabulations, colors and global design of the logger system

Cleanup:

	Added a Cleanup function which kills asynchroneous Cgi processes, closes all connections etc..
	Added a SIGTERM and SIGQUIT handlers which calls the Cleanup function
