Webserv
This is when you finally understand why URLs start with HTTP

Summary:
This project is about writing your own HTTP server.
You will be able to test it with an actual browser.
HTTP is one of the most widely used protocols on the internet.
Understanding its intricacies will be useful, even if you won’t be working on a website.

Chapter I – Introduction

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed,
collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext
documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.

HTTP was developed to support hypertext functionality and the growth of the World Wide Web.

The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to clients.
Client-server communication occurs through HTTP.

Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images,
style sheets, and scripts.

Although its primary function is to serve content, HTTP also enables clients to send data,
such as submitting forms and uploading files.

==================================================
Chapter II – General rules

- Your program must not crash under any circumstances.
- You must submit a Makefile that compiles your source files.
- Required Makefile rules: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re.
- Compile with: -Wall -Wextra -Werror
- Code must comply with C++98.
- Prefer C++ standard libraries over C libraries.
- External libraries and Boost are forbidden.

==================================================
Chapter III – AI Instructions

Context:
AI can assist with many tasks, but results must be critically assessed.

Main message:
- Use AI to reduce repetitive tasks.
- Develop strong prompting skills.
- Understand AI risks, biases, and ethics.
- Work with peers.
- Only use AI-generated content you fully understand.

Learner rules:
- Understand AI tools before using them.
- Reflect before prompting.
- Systematically review AI outputs.
- Always seek peer review.

==================================================
Chapter IV – Mandatory part

Program name: webserv
Description: An HTTP server written in C++98

Execution:
./webserv [configuration file]

You must implement the server using non-blocking I/O and a single poll() or equivalent
(select, epoll, kqueue).

Allowed system calls include:
execve, fork, socket, bind, listen, accept, send, recv, poll, select, epoll, read, write, etc.

==================================================
IV.1 Requirements

- Use a configuration file.
- Server must be non-blocking at all times.
- Only one poll() (or equivalent) for all I/O.
- Never read/write without poll readiness.
- Accurate HTTP status codes required.
- Must support GET, POST, DELETE.
- Must serve static websites.
- Must support file uploads.
- Default error pages required.
- Compatible with standard browsers.
- fork allowed only for CGI.

==================================================
IV.2 For MacOS only

- fcntl() is allowed to achieve non-blocking behavior.
- Allowed flags: F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK, FD_CLOEXEC.

==================================================
IV.3 Configuration file

You should be able to:
- Define multiple ports.
- Set default error pages.
- Set maximum request body size.
- Configure routes:
  * Allowed HTTP methods
  * Redirections
  * Root directories
  * Directory listing
  * Default index files
  * File upload locations
- Configure CGI execution by file extension.

==================================================
Chapter V – Bonus part

Optional features:
- Cookies and session management.
- Multiple CGI types.

Bonus is evaluated only if the mandatory part is perfect.

==================================================
Chapter VI – Submission and peer-evaluation

- Submit your project via Git repository.
- Only repository content is evaluated.
- You may be asked to make small live modifications.
- This verifies real understanding of the project.
