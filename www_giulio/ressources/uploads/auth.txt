Authentication is a server-side job, where the server verifies the user's identity, while the webpage's role is to handle the user interface and securely transmit the credentials to the server. The server checks the submitted credentials against its database, generates a session, and sends a cookie or token back to the browser, which then uses it for future requests to stay logged in. 

Server's role

	- Verifies credentials: 
		The server receives the username and password from the browser and 
		checks them against its stored, hashed user data.
	- Creates a session: 
		If the credentials are valid, the server creates a temporary user session.
	- Issues a session token: 
		The server generates a unique session ID,  which it sends to the browser 
		in the form of a cookie.
	- Authorizes access: The server is responsible for confirming 
		that the authenticated user is allowed to access specific resources. 

Webpage's role

	- Collects user input: 
		The webpage provides the login form for the user to enter their username and password.
	- Sends credentials to server: 
		The browser sends the entered credentials to the server, typically via a POST request.
	- Stores the session cookie: 
		The browser receives the session cookie from the server and stores it.
	- Includes session token with requests: 
		For subsequent requests to the server, the browser automatically includes the session cookie to prove the user is still logged in. 

The authentication flow

User interaction: The user enters their credentials on the webpage and submits the form.
Browser sends request: The browser sends the credentials to the server.
Server verifies: The server checks the credentials against its database.
Server responds: If successful, the server sends back a session ID in a cookie. If unsuccessful, it sends an error.
Browser stores cookie: The browser stores the session cookie.
Future requests: On every subsequent request to a protected resource, the browser sends the session cookie back to the server.
Server maintains session: The server uses the cookie to identify the user and allow access without re-prompting for login.
